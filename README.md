## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Artifact-ML eliminates imperative glue code in ML experiments by providing the tools to build **reusable** workflows **declaratively**.

By *reusable*, we refer to workflows that are defined once with the potential to be reused by any model within the same task category.

By *declarative*, we refer to building through expressing high-level intent---rather than catering to implementation details.

For additional context, please refer to our [value proposition](value_proposition.md) and [motivating example](motivating_example.md) docs.

## üèóÔ∏è Packages

The project comprises three packages:

- [`artifact-core`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-core): foundational interfaces and abstractions for building validation workflows.
- [`artifact-experiment`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-experiment): experiment tracking toolkit supporting popular tracking backends (e.g. [Mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)).
- [`artifact-torch`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-torch): interfaces and abstractions for building deep learning experiments.
