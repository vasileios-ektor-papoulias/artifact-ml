## Component

Indicate which component this PR affects

- root
- core
- experiment
- torch

---

## Version Bump Type *(for PRs to main)*

Prefix your PR title accordingly (e.g., "patch: fix bug")
- `patch` — backwards-compatible bug fix  
- `minor` — backwards-compatible feature addition  
- `major` — breaking change  
- `no-bump` — no version bump required

> ⚠️ Root PRs must use `no-bump` (enforced).
> ⚠️ Hotfix PRs must use `patch` (convention).  
> ⚠️ Setup PRs must use `no-bump` (convention).
