`artifact-experiment` constitutes the experiment orchestration and tracking extension to Artifact-ML.

It provides tools to build complete reusable, validation workflows with integrated tracking via pure declarative configuration.

It stands alongside:

- [`artifact-core`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-core): a unified interface for the declarative computation of diverse validation artifacts in ML experiments.
- [`artifact-torch`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-torch): PyTorch integration for building reusable deep-learning workflows declaratively.
