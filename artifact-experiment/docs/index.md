[`artifact-experiment`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-experiment) constitutes the experiment orchestration extension to [Artifact-ML](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml).

It provides the tools to build reusable validation workflows with integrated tracking using popular backend services (e.g. [Mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)).

It stands alongside:

- [`artifact-core`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-core): a declarative interface for the computation of validation artifacts in ML experiments.
- [`artifact-torch`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-torch): PyTorch integration for building reusable deep-learning workflows declaratively.
