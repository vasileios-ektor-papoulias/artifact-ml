## Overview

[Artifact-ML](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main) eliminates imperative glue code in ML experiments by providing the tools to build **reusable** workflows **declaratively**.

By *reusable*, we refer to workflows that are defined once with the potential to be reused by any model within the same task category.

By *declarative*, we refer to building through expressing high-level intent---rather than catering to implementation details.
