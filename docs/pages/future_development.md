## Expanding Validation Capabilities: New Domain-Specific Toolkits

We plan to continue expanding the framework by releasing engines tailored to other types of ML experiments:

- synthetic tabular time-series generation,
- synthetic image generation,
- text generation,
- multiclass classification.

These extensions will maintain the same core philosophy of decoupling validation logic from model implementation, allowing researchers to focus on innovation while ensuring consistent evaluation practices.

## Enhanced Integration

Future versions will provide deeper integration with popular ML frameworks and tools:

- integration with other machine learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow),
- support for distributed validation on large datasets (e.g. integration with PySpark),

## Performance Optimization

- running validation asynchronously in the background via a distributed task manager
