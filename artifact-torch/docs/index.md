# artifact-torch

`artifact-torch` provides PyTorch integration for the Artifact framework.

It offers the tools required to build reusable, end-to-end deep learning workflows declaratiely.

It stands alongside:

- [`artifact-core`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-core): a unified interface for the declarative computation of diverse validation artifacts in ML experiments.
- [`artifact-experiment`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-experiment): The framework's experiment tracking extension.
