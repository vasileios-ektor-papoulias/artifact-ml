[`artifact-torch`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-torch) provides Pytorch integration for [Artifact-ML](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/).

It offers the tools to build reusable deep learning workflows declaratively.

It handles **all aspects of the training loop** aside from model architecture and data pipelines, abstracting away engineering complexity to let researchers focus on architectural innovation.

It stands alongside:

- [`artifact-core`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-core): a declarative interface for the computation of validation artifacts in ML experiments.
- [`artifact-experiment`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-experiment): experiment orchestration extension for building reusable validation workflows with integrated tracking.
