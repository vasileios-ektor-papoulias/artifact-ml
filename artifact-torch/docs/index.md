`artifact-torch` provides PyTorch integration for the Artifact framework.

It offers the tools required to build reusable, end-to-end deep learning workflows declaratiely.

It stands alongside:
- [`artifact-core`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-core): Framework foundation providing a uniform minimal interface for the computation of validation artifacts.
- [`artifact-experiment`](https://github.com/vasileios-ektor-papoulias/artifact-ml/tree/main/artifact-experiment): The framework's experiment tracking extension.
